Stellar Attestation Service - Serves You (SASSY)


## Overview

The Stellar Attestation Service - Serves You (SASSY) is an open-source project aimed at porting the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) to the Stellar blockchain. This project converts Solidity-based EAS contracts into Rust-based Stellar smart contracts, leveraging Stellar's Soroban smart contract platform.

## Goals

1. Implement core EAS functionality on Stellar
2. Optimize for Stellar's unique features and constraints
3. Ensure compatibility with existing EAS schemas and data structures
4. Provide a seamless transition for developers familiar with EAS

## Features

- Rust-based smart contracts for Stellar's Soroban platform
- Schema management and validation
- On-chain attestation creation and revocation
- Compatibility layer for EAS data structures

## Getting Started
